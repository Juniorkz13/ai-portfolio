# 🖼️ Image Classification with Transfer Learning (PyTorch)

## 📌 Overview

This project presents a **production-style Computer Vision pipeline** for **natural scene image classification**, built with **PyTorch** and **Transfer Learning**.

The focus is not only on model accuracy, but on demonstrating **ML engineering best practices**, including:
- robust dataset handling  
- GPU-accelerated training  
- modular and reusable code  
- honest evaluation with real-world metrics  

This repository reflects the workflow of a **Machine Learning / Computer Vision Engineer**, not a tutorial-level experiment.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given an input image of a natural environment, the model predicts one of the following categories:

- buildings  
- forest  
- glacier  
- mountain  
- sea  
- street  

This is a **multi-class image classification** problem involving **visually similar classes** (e.g. *glacier vs mountain*), making it a strong benchmark for evaluating model generalization.

## 🧪 Data Pipeline

- Image loading via `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder`
- Input resolution: **224 × 224**
- Normalization: ImageNet mean and standard deviation
- Data augmentation (training only):
  - Random horizontal flip
  - Random rotation
  - Color jitter

This setup is fully compatible with **ImageNet-pretrained CNN architectures**.

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **Backbone:** ResNet-50 (pretrained on ImageNet)
- **Approach:** Transfer Learning
  - Backbone layers frozen
  - Custom classification head added

### Classification Head

- Linear layer (2048 → 256)
- ReLU activation
- Dropout (0.5)
- Linear layer (256 → 6)

This design enables fast convergence and strong generalization with limited training epochs.

## ⚙️ Training Configuration

- Framework: PyTorch  
- Device: GPU (NVIDIA RTX 2060)  
- Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss  
- Optimizer: Adam  
- Learning Rate: 1e-3  
- Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau  
- Epochs: 10  
- Checkpointing: best model saved based on validation loss  

Training and validation loops are fully separated and GPU-aware.

## 📊 Evaluation Results

Evaluation was performed on the **seg_test** dataset.

| Class      | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| buildings | 0.93 | 0.89 | 0.91 |
| forest   | 1.00 | 0.97 | 0.98 |
| glacier  | 0.86 | 0.84 | 0.85 |
| mountain | 0.86 | 0.83 | 0.84 |
| sea      | 0.91 | 0.97 | 0.94 |
| street   | 0.89 | 0.95 | 0.92 |

**Overall Accuracy:** **91%**

### Key Observations

- Strong performance on visually distinctive classes (*forest*, *sea*)
- Most confusion occurs between **glacier ↔ mountain**, which is expected
- Errors are semantically reasonable, indicating good generalization
